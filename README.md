# hamster-flask

Cloned from  https://github.com/projecthamster/flask-hamster on 2019-09-02.

Experimental hamster flask app. Right now it's super rough and can only list your current activites and start new activities. Toma BauÄ£is started the original project "merely to pick up flask and advanced javascript, but the general direction makes sense, methinks!"

This version works again with python3 and python3-flask.

## Installing

On first usage an empty sqlite3 DB will be created in `~/.config/hamster-flask/hamster.db`. The DB is fully compatible with [legacy hamster](https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster) so you can copy an existing hamster.db (eg. from `~/.local/share/hamster-applet`) over it.

You should probably create a python3 virtualenv for this project, then: `pip3 install flask`.
Alternatively, use your linux distribution's tools to install python3-flask system wide.

Run the app from your git clone directory as:
`./hamster-flask.py`
and point your browser at: http://localhost:5000/ .
