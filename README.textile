h1. hamster-flask

Cloned from  https://github.com/projecthamster/flask-hamster.


Experimental hamster flask app. Right now it's super rough and can only list your current activites.
Toma BauÄ£is started this project "merely to pick up flask and advanced javascript, but the general 
direction makes sense, methinks!"

h1. Installing

On first usage an empty sqlite3 DB will be created in `~/.config/hamster-flask/hamster.db`. The DB is fully compatible with [legacy hamster]"https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster" so you can copy an existing hamster.db (eg. from `~/.local/share/hamster-applet`) over it.

You should probably create a virtualenv for this project, then: @pip install -r requirements.txt@.
Alternatively, use your linux distribution's tools to install python-flask system wide.

Run the app from your git clone directory as:
# @./hamster-flask.py@
# and point your browser at localhost: http://localhost:5000/
